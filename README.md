# tic-tac-toe-python-developer
A simple project involving a Tic-Tac-Toe simulator (as seen on the JetBrains Academy / Hyperskill Python developer plan)

### About
Everybody remembers this paper-and-pencil game from childhood: Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and crosses or Xs and Os. A single mistake usually costs you the game, but thankfully it is simple enough that most players discover the best strategy quickly. Let’s program Tic-Tac-Toe and get playing!

### Learning outcomes
After finishing this project, you'll get to know a lot about planning and developing a complex program from scratch, using functions, handling errors, and processing user input.

###  Stage 1/5: Welcome to the battlefield!
To start things off, the program needs to be able to print any state of the field. You’ll write a serious multi-line program using a lot of prints.

### Stage 2/5: The user is the gamemaster
Now it’s time to analyze user input and print the state of the field depending on it. You’ll learn to address specific positions in a string to achieve the required outcome.
