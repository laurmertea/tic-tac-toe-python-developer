# Description
# Nowadays, this game is known all over the world. Each country may have its own version of the name, 
# sometimes the rules are different, but the meaning of the game remains the same. 
# Below are the main rules that may be familiar to you since childhood.
# Tic-tac-toe is a game played by two players on a 3x3 field where the duel takes place. 
# One of the players plays as 'X', and the other player is 'O'. 
# 'X' plays first, then the 'O' side plays, and so on.
# The first player that writes 3 'X' or 3 'O' in a straight line (including diagonals) wins.
#
